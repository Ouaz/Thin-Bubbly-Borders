# Thin Bubbly Borders

Latest version: April 6th, 2025

Original Bubbly Borders mod creator: [will-ca](https://github.com/will-ca/Bubbly-Borders-Example)

Compared to default borders, Thin Bubbly Borders makes easier to see:

- "clash" points between civ territories
- unowned tiles inside or between civ territories
- roads crossing two borders
- rivers being on the same tile edge than a border
- global shapes for all territories when zooming out
