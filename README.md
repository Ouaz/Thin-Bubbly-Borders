# Thin Bubbly Borders

Latest version: June 12th, 2022

Original Bubbly Borders mod creator: [will-ca](https://github.com/will-ca/Bubbly-Borders-Example)

Compared to default borders, Thin Bubbly Borders makes:

- Easier to see "clash" points between civ territories
- Easier to see unowned tiles inside or between civ territories
- Easier to see roads crossing two borders
- Easier to see rivers being on the same tile edge than a border
- Easier to see all territories global shapes when zooming out
